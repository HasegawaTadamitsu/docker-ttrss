# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of this image is supported. If you're not running the latest version of the image, please upgrade at your earliest convenience.  

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find something that compromises the security of your installation *caused by this Docker image*, you should [send me a message](mailto:thegrumpydictator@gmail.com) as soon as possible. These issues will be fixed immediately. You can also open an issue, but if you feel the issue is sensitive, please drop me a message instead.

You can use my [GPG key](https://keybase.io/jc5) for extra security. My GitHub commits are almost always signed with this key.

Please note that I can't guarantee the software itself is free of vulnerabilities, and I can't be held responsible for them.
